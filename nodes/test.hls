- rayleigh scattering is how photons are scattered by molecules much smaller than the wavelength of the photon
  - the sky is blue because of a phenonmenom called {{rayleigh scattering}}
    - shadows outside are {{blue-ish}} because of {{rayleigh scattering}}
  - n: this is a note
  - rayleigh scattering equation is "{{intensity of scattering}} is {{proportional to}} {{(frequency ^ 4)}}
    - if you {{half the}} wavelength, the rayleigh scattering {{increases by a factor of 16 (2^4)}}
    - if you {{double}} the wavelength, the rayleigh scattering {{decreases by a factor of 16 (2^4)}}
  - in the atmosphere, violet light is scattered {{more}} than blue light
  - the sky is blue and not purple because {{the sun emits less violet than blue light}} and {{our eyes are more sensitive to blue than violet}}
  - the {{atmosphere}} is full of mostly {{nitrogen}} and {{oxygen}} particles
  - nitrogen and oxygen molecules are {{much smaller::size}} than the wavelength of visibile light
  - the sun can appear yellow because {{some of the blue has been scattered away (rayleigh scattering)}}
  - if you turned off the sun and shined a bright white narrow light into the sky, it would {{look blue}} because {{of rayleigh scattering}}
  - sunrise/sunset appears red because {{light must travel through hundreds of more miles of atmosphere to reach you, scattering it more}}
