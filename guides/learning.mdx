## How to remember forever

### Spaced repetition

The basis of how you'll remember forever is easy. It's flashcards. But more than that, it's **spaced repetition** flashcards.

(A flashcard is a simple question and an answer)

Spaced repetition is a learning method that shows you information right before you're about to forget it. This way, your brain strengthens the memory at just the right time, making it stick for the long run.

Instead of cramming and forgetting, you review flashcards at carefully spaced intervals—longer and longer over time.

Here's an example. You make a new card. On the first day, you'll maybe study that card twice. Then the next time you'll study it is in a week. After that, it's in a month. After that, it's in six months. This way, you spend less time studying each flashcard but can remember it forever.

There's a huge benefit in spaced repetition. It saves you a ton of time. Michael Nielson estimated that using spaced repetition is 20x more time-efficient than studying a flashcard every week. In 20 years, it would take about 2 hours of time per card without spaced repetition, and only abjout 5 minutes with spaced repetition.[https://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html]

### Software

There are many spaced repetition softwares out there. The most popular is [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)

It’s used a lot in Medical school, because people have to remember lots of facts there.

So, go and download Anki. It's incredible software that will improve your learning.

Some other options are Supermemo and AnkiPro.

### Interleaving

Most people organize their flashcards into different decks—one for math, one for science, one for history. This is a mistake.

Instead, you should use only one deck and mix all your subjects together. This technique is called interleaving.

Why is interleaving better?

- **Mimics real-world learning**: In life, knowledge is mixed. You don’t only think about math when doing math; sometimes, math connects to programming, physics, or economics. Interleaving strengthens those connections.

- **Strengthens recall**: When you mix topics, your brain works harder to retrieve answers. This difficulty makes your memory stronger.

- **Prevents mindless review**: If you review similar cards back to back (e.g., all history cards at once), your brain gets lazy. Mixing cards forces real thinking.

Bottom line: Keep one deck for everything. Let the software handle the randomness. You’ll learn faster and make better connections.

### Format

This is the format:

```none

Q: "Category: Question?"

A: "Answer (Source)"

```

Why use this format?

- **Sets the context immediately**: By putting the category at the start, your brain instantly knows which subject area to focus on, reducing distractions and priming you for the right type of thinking.

Examples:

```
Q: "JS: What does map() do?"
A: "Creates a new array with the results of calling a function on every element (MDN)"

Q: "Physics: What is Newton's first law?"
A: "An object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an external force (Feynman Lectures)"

Q: "Biology: What is ATP?"
A: "Molecule that stores and transfers energy in cells (Campbell's Biology)"

```

### Short

You want your questions to be as short as possible because this reduces the number of paths to getting that answer. Fewer paths strengthen that path, so if you are introduced to a question, you want to think of the exact same answer every time. Making your answers very short helps with this.

Why use short flashcards:

- **Strengthens recall pathways**: Short, concise questions reinforce a single memory path, ensuring that when you see the question, the specific answer comes quickly and accurately.
- **Minimizes confusion**: Fewer words mean less room for misinterpretation or mixing up details, which is crucial for solidifying your understanding.
- **Saves time during review**: Short cards are quicker to go through, which keeps your study sessions efficient and maintains a high level of focus throughout your reviews.

Examples:

```
Bad:

Q: "History: When did the Roman Empire fall?"
A: "The Roman Empire fell in 476 AD when the last emperor, Romulus Augustulus, was deposed by the Germanic leader Odoacer."

Good:

Q: "History: When did Rome fall?"
A: "476 AD"

Bad:

Q: "Math: What is the area formula for a circle?"
A: "The formula for the area of a circle is pi times the radius squared."

Good:

Q: "Math: Area of a circle?"
A: "πr²"


```

### Atomic

Each flashcard should cover exactly one idea. No more.

Why?

- **Isolates individual concepts**: Each flashcard covering one idea ensures you build a strong, dedicated memory for that fact without interference from unrelated information.
- **Enhances retention and clarity**: When you focus on a single idea, you avoid overloading your brain, leading to better long-term retention and a clearer understanding of each topic.

Here's an example:

```
Bad:

Q: "What are the three types of rocks?"
A: "Igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks, which form through cooling lava, compression of sediments, and heat/pressure transformation."

Good:

Q: "Geology: What are the three types of rocks?"
A: "Igneous, sedimentary, metamorphic"

Q: "Geology: How do igneous rocks form?"
A: "Cooling lava"

Q: "Geology: How do sedimentary rocks form?"
A: "Compression of sediments"

Q: "Geology: How do metamorphic rocks form?"
A: "Heat and pressure transformation"

```

Here's an example by Piotr Wozniak:

Bad:

```
Q: What are the characteristics of the Dead Sea?
A: Salt lake located on the border between Israel and Jordan. Its shoreline is the lowest point on the Earth’s surface, averaging 396 m below sea level. It is 74 km long. It is seven times as salty (30% by volume) as the ocean. Its density keeps swimmers afloat. Only simple organisms can live in its saline waters
```

Good:

```
Q: Where is the Dead Sea located?
A: on the border between Israel and Jordan
Q: What is the lowest point on the Earth’s surface?
A: The Dead Sea shoreline
Q: What is the average level on which the Dead Sea is located?
A: 400 meters (below sea level)
Q: How long is the Dead Sea?
A: 70 km
Q: How much saltier is the Dead Sea than the oceans?
A: 7 times
Q: What is the volume content of salt in the Dead Sea?
A: 30%
Q: Why can the Dead Sea keep swimmers afloat?
A: due to high salt content
Q: Why is the Dead Sea called Dead?
A: because only simple organisms can live in it
Q: Why only simple organisms can live in the Dead Sea?
A: because of high salt content
```

### Reverse flashcards

For some questions, you want to have the reverse of that flashcard as well—two flashcards for each.

This is very helpful for definitions because you can memorize both paths leading to that concept.

Memory often works one way; you might remember that A leads to B but not that B leads to A. So you have to strengthen both directions, sometimes.

For example:

"Definition of instrumental rationality?" "Systematically achieving your goals"

So you'll remember the definition of instrumental rationality. But you might not remember what the word for "Systematically achieving your goals" is.

To fix this, make the reverse of that card. Like so:

"Word for systematically achieving your goals?" "Instrumental rationality"

Examples:

```
Q: "Physics: What is inertia?"
A: "An object's resistance to changes in motion"

Q: "Physics: What is the term for an object's resistance to changes in motion?"
A: "Inertia"

```

```
Q: "French: What does 'chien' mean?"
A: "Dog"

Q: "French: Word for 'dog'?"
A: "Chien"

```

### "Why" cards

There's a huge difference between knowing that something is true and knowing why it is true.

Knowing why it's true is way more important. Knowing why leads to understanding. With many of your questions, you want to ask, "Why is this true?" and make a flashcard from that.

```
Q: "Physics: Why does a heavier object fall at the same speed as a lighter one?"
A: "Because gravity accelerates all objects equally, regardless of mass"

Q: "Biology: Why do we need oxygen?"
A: "It’s required for cellular respiration to produce ATP"

Q: "Math: Why is dividing by zero undefined?"
A: "Because it leads to contradictions and infinite values in equations"

```

### Avoid terms

I don't like to make flashcards based on terms. A term adds another breakpoint to your learning. For example, if you memorize that "priming is your brain making connections between things," you can use that, but it's often better to use the definition of the term directly. This way, you can understand things and make connections between them.

## How to apply knowledge in real life

### Examples

You want to have many examples of the concept and compare and contrast those examples.

This allows you to make connections between those things and be able to use them in real life.

For example, you might know what the Pythagorean Theorem. But struggle to recognize real-life situations where it's used.

To fix this, think of three real-life examples. Then, find what's the same and what's different in the examples.

This helps you grasp the idea and use it in real life.

(That's why I include three examples for each concept—to show how it's used in real life.)

There's a big difference between knowing something and being able to use it in real life.

If you can, memorize the examples. For example, ask yourself, "What is (a^3)^4?" and test yourself to see if you know the answer. (It's a^12)

## How to understand perfectly

### Feynman technique

A great way to ensure that you actually know something is to explain it to a fifth grader. This is the Feynman Technique.

Explain it simply, and as you do, you'll come across things you don't know.

When that happens:

- Return to the source material

- Fill the gaps in your knowledge

- Continue explaining until you understand the concept well.

For the Feynman Technique, I often use ChatGPT to fill in my gaps of knowledge, because it's easy to ask a question and get an answer.

Why use the Feynman technique?

- **Simplifies complex ideas**: Explaining a topic as if to a fifth grader forces you to break it down into its most fundamental components, making even the most complicated subjects more accessible.
- **Reveals knowledge gaps**: When you struggle to explain a concept clearly, it’s a clear sign that you need to revisit and deepen your understanding, ensuring you don’t overlook important details.
- **Enhances retention**: Teaching a topic, even if only to an imagined audience, engages your brain in active learning, making it far more likely that you'll remember the information.
- **Promotes active engagement**: Rather than passively reading or listening, the Feynman Technique requires you to actively construct and reconstruct knowledge, which helps cement the material in your memory.

Example

1. Explain it to a 5th grader

> Imagine a plant is like a little chef in a kitchen. The plant takes sunlight, water, and a gas from the air called carbon dioxide, and mixes them together to make food. The food helps the plant grow big and strong, and as a bonus, it makes oxygen that we breathe!

2. Find gaps in your explaination

While explaining, you might realize:

- "I mentioned water and sunlight, but how exactly do they interact inside the plant?"
- "What happens to the food once it's made?"

3. Fill in the gaps

Research or ask an expert (or even use ChatGPT) to answer:

- How do the chloroplasts in plant cells capture sunlight?
- What are the detailed steps in the chemical reactions of photosynthesis?

4. Improve your explanation
   > "Inside a plant’s leaves are special parts called chloroplasts that act like tiny solar panels. They catch sunlight and use it to mix water (taken up through the roots) and carbon dioxide (from the air) in a chemical reaction. This reaction creates a sugar called glucose, which gives the plant energy to grow. As a side effect, the plant also produces oxygen, which it releases into the air."

### Free tutor

AI is an amazing learning tutor.

I ask ChatGPT tons of questions every day, and it helps me solidify my understanding.

It's also how I get my examples and make Anki flashcards.

If you have a question, it's like an expert on that topic who can answer and help you understand.

## How to learn rapidly

### No multitasking

When you learn, avoid multitasking.

Your brain is not designed to handle many tasks at once. Instead, it's switching between tasks. This is bad for your attention because some of your focus remains on the old task.

It's more effective to learn by doing one task at a time.

Keep in mind that whenever you are learning, you want to be very focused and avoid distractions. Put away your phone, don't switch tasks, and learn until you understand it.

### My process

My process for learning looks like this:

- I'll read a text
- When I find something I want to remember, I copy and paste it into a text document.
- Every day, I go through the text document and make Anki flashcards from it.
- I make sure to create both the base flashcard, the reverse flashcard, and "why" flashcards if needed.
- As I make these, I ensure that I understand the material and use the Feynman Technique when writing these posts. This ensures I actually understand the content.
- Then, I use ChatGPT to convert the flashcards into a CSV file.
- Import them into Anki.
- Study them every day.
