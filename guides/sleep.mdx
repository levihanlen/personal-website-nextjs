## Sleep is crucial

When you don’t sleep well, you age faster, store more fat, make more errors, think slower, etc.

> You’re not healthy unless your sleep is healthy.

You don’t know how sleep-deprived you are when you’re sleep-deprived.

The better sleep you get, the more productive and effective you’ll be. Prioritize your sleep.

## Electronics

Turn off electronics more than 90 minutes before sleeping. Don’t have your phone in your room when you sleep.

I wear blue light glasses for two hours before I sleep.

## Darkness

Sleep in a dark environment—so dark you can’t see your hands in front of your face. Your skin can “see” too, so covering your eyes won’t work.

Buy blackout curtains to block light.

## Caffeine

Don’t drink caffeine for 8 hours before bed. Caffeine doesn’t give you energy; it masks fatigue. Or, better yet, don’t drink caffeine at all.

## Temperature

The ideal temperature to sleep in is 60-68 degrees Fahrenheit.

## Meditation

Meditation in the morning is proven to help sleep.

Before you go to sleep, take five deep breaths. Breathe in for 6 seconds, hold for 2, and exhale for 8.

## How to fall asleep in two minutes

1. Relax your face, including inside your mouth.
2. Drop your shoulders as low as they can go. Relax your right and then left arm.
3. Relax chest, legs, thighs, calves.
4. Focus on a relaxing scene.
   1. If this doesn’t work, repeat “don’t think” for 10 seconds.

Don’t think of anything involving moving around; this activates your brain too much.

> First, we want you to fantasize that it is a warm spring day and you are lying in the bottom of a canoe on a very serene lake. You are looking up at a blue sky with lazy, floating clouds. Do not allow any other thought to creep in

Relax your body to its fullest extent. Let your jaw sag and drop open. Go through each body part and individually relax it. Imagine that it’s getting very heavy and release all tension.
