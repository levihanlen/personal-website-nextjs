## Monotask

This is more efficient to learn. Do deep work. This allows you to cement skills faster.

## Test yourself

Test yourself to make sure you truly know it.

Testing yourself also shows you your weaker points and how to improve them.

## Breaks

Take breaks. After 90 minutes of working, rest for 20 minutes. For example, you can read a book, meditate, or relax.

## Simple

Make the learning as simple as possible—simplify your language and note the information clearly in lists and small sentences.

## Feynman technique

It is a method to learn quickly and truly understand the content. Memorization is not understanding.

The premise is that you don’t understand something until you can explain it to a fifth-grader. If you can’t explain something clearly and simply, you don’t understand it well enough.

There are four steps:

1. Choose a concept to learn.
2. Teach it to yourself or someone else
   1. Write everything you know about it as if you were explaining.
3. Return to the source material if you get stuck.
   1. Fill in the gaps of your knowledge.
4. Simplify your explanations and create analogies

True understanding requires a more active process, like teaching, not just reading. Write out a summary in your own words without looking at your notes. Then, take it to the next level by teaching other people.

Explaining everything without looking at the source material or notes reveals your weak areas. Reviewing the source material afterward helps strengthen the weak areas.

Analogies are easy to remember.
