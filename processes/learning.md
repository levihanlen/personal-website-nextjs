# learning a topic

- start by getting ai to write you a guide. this is generally a good start.
  - then tell it to give yuo the best materials via which you can learn it
- read the materials
  - SUB reading
- for practical things
  - write out an entire process. each step should be easy and achievable.

# reading

- choose a book
- recursively do this process
  - ask ai to summarize with this prompt:
    > summarize with bullet points. dense with information. use simple language. write everything of value (summarized)
  - if you would gain value from reading it in-depth, do so
- ai summarize process for:
  - the entire book. give it the book name. if the summary does not show that the book is valuable, don't read it
  - each section in the book. generally not a whole chapter
- you summarize
  - each note you take, summarize it
  - each chapter, summarize it
  - summarize the entire book
- if it gives a point of view for something that is opposite yours. highlight it and summarize their viewpoint
- whenever you have a question, write it down and struggle with the question yourself a bit and write down your guess to the solution.
  - write it down with this syntax. "q: why is blah blah blah"
- once yuo're done with the book, you now have a summarized version of the book by you
  - do a quick check to see if there are any obvious issues/errors
    are there any errors/incorrect parts of this? answer any questions i had
  - organize the notes into indented bullet piont list, where each root node is a concept
  - building understanding (feynman technique)
    - for those concepts repeatedly ask "why?", write your reasoning down
    - then give this to ai, and ask it to be like a 5th grader learning this and to ask questions
      > pretend you're a curious 5th grader. ask numbered questions (like the feynman technique). the questions should not be testing anything i already know. they should force me to understand more. ex: if my notes say “the sky is blue becuase of rayleigh scattering”. don't ask “why is the sky blue?” (because i already know that). ask “what is rayleigh scattering?” provide answers at the end of yuor response
  - building real-life application (examples)
    - think of examples yourself
    - ask ai for examples
      > give many different examples that use the principles here. make them diverse so i can have diverse and deep understanding of the content
    - for each of those examples, compare and contrast them, write down the differences and why you think those differences are there
  - ask ai to:
    - propose thought experiments on this
      > ask me hypotheticals that will expand my understand. ask the hypotheticals, and then at the end of your response provide the answers
    - quiz me on this
- ankify it
  - each line is a flashcard
    - must have a clear cue
    - must be easily understandable and not interfere with other cards
- you now have a semi-organized guide
  - get ai and other to read over it. point out the flaws and what makes it a bad read
  - SUB: editing

the process of learning somethin gis this.

- discovering you have a gap in your skill/knowledge
- finding the concept that will fill that gap
- gaining initial comfortability with that theory of the concep
- analyzing the theory on a deeper level (understanding)
- memorizing theory
- practicing it until it is strongly connected in your brain (habit)
- upkeep of the memory with anki
