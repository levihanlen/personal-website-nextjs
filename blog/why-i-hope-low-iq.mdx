No, seriously—I genuinely hope that I have a low IQ. I know it sounds insane. But it's true. And I have a good reason.

If I ever take an IQ test, I hope my score is something like 80. In fact, the lower the better. Why? Because it would mean most people are smarter than me—and that’s a fantastic thing.

And for that matter, I hope I’m the least productive person I know, the most irrational, the rudest, and the meanest. I hope everyone else surpasses me in those areas. Here’s why.

## The value of being the worst

I already know roughly how smart I am, and I’m happy with it. Now it'd be awesome if I were twice as smart, but I want to be in the lowest percentile of intelligence. Ideally, I want to be the dumbest person alive.

If I found out I had an incredibly low IQ, it would mean that most of the world has a higher IQ, and therefore, most of the world is better off.

Here's another example. I'm one of the calmest people I know. Let's assume that I stay at the same level of calmness—that doesn't change. Then I wake up one day and everyone is calmer than me. Suddenly, I’m the angriest person in the room. Wouldn’t that be amazing? I would be _happy_. That would mean the world has collectively become better at managing emotions. That’s a _great_ thing.

However, if I were to find out that I’m one of the calmest people in the world, it would mean that most of the world is angry.

When you look at things from the perspective of trying to be “the best,” it’s inherently self-centered.

This isn’t to say you shouldn’t strive to be the best version of yourself—you absolutely should. Always work on improving yourself. Be the best you can be, the smartest you can be, the happiest you can be. But the key is not to do it to beat others. Do it to improve yourself. And hope that others are doing amazingly.

Assuming that my life stays exactly the same, I’d rather be in the bottom 1% than the top 1%. Why? Because the bottom 1% means the rest of the world is better off. That’s a world worth living in.

## Your clone

Here’s another thought experiment: You look in the mirror one day as you get out from the shower. It's Christmas time, so naturally you're humming _All I Want for Christmas_ to yourself. Suddenly, you from the mirror climbs out and is now standing next to you. You're shocked and terrified, but eventually your mirror-self manages to calm you down.

They sit you down on the couch and explain to you. The mirror-you is a clone of you. They are exactly like you in every way, except they are 10% smarter.

Your mirror-self is distraught, however. They say that only one of you can live in this universe. The other must die. Your mirror-self doesn't want to kill you, so they give you the choice.

You can either kill your clone (the mirror-self) or kill yourself.

What do you choose?

Logically, you would have to choose to kill yourself. Why? Because the clone is smarter—they can do more, change more lives, and live a happier, more impactful life.

I’ve brought this up with friends, and I’ve been surprised by how many people say they’d kill the clone. But if the clone is better suited to survive and thrive, the only reason you’d choose yourself is bias.

This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t love your life—it just means you should respect that others love their lives just as much as you love yours. Your life is no more important than anyone else’s.

Well, unless your life _is_ different ...

## Selflessness

This can be a tricky dilemma for very selfless individuals. Let’s say you have to choose between saving yourself and someone else. Who do you choose?

From a utilitarian perspective, you’d have to choose the person who **maximizes the long-term well-being of conscious beings**.

If that’s them, you’d have to save them. If that’s you, you’d have to save yourself.

People often think they should be selfless and always save the other. Or they think selfishly and always save themselves. Don't do that. Choose the most logical option.

## Marginal victories

Now, let’s take the thought experiment even further.

You're looking in the mirror again. And another clone steps out. It's a similar deal this time.

Everything about them is the same as you, except they are 0.1% better at knitting—or some other random, inconsequential skill.

Who do you choose to keep alive?

It’s a tough question. Does being better at knitting really matter? For most people, it doesn’t. But from a utilitarian perspective, you’d still have to choose them because they did something better. Even if it’s a trivial difference, they’ve outperformed you in one small area, and that’s enough to make them the better choice.

If you can honestly say you’d sacrifice yourself in favor of the clone, even for such a small difference, then congrats. You can say that you're a moral person.

Now, in real life, decisions aren't like this. You're never going to come across a situation like this. But whenever you make a decision, remove your own biases from the equation. Think of it as choosing between two strangers. See things from the view of the collective humanity, not from the eyes of one human.

## How to actually use these ideas

1. Celebrate other's successes.
2. Focus on collaboration more than competition (though competition can be good in many cases).
3. See things how they are, not how you want them to be.
4. When thinking of something where you are biased to preserve yourself, think of yourself as a stranger.
5. Be the best you possibly can.

## The world I want to see

So, if I ever take an IQ test, I'll try my absolute hardest, but I’ll cross my fingers for the lowest score possible. Not because I want to be “less,” but because I want the world to be _more_.
