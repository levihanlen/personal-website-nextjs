This is my first blog post, so while I was thinking about how to write a blog, I wondered: how do I actually make it valuable? I believe the answer is reasonably simple.

You can quantify how valuable knowledge is by how much it **changes your behavior**.

Let's say I wrote a blog on how to sew a shirt. OK, cool. But, I bet not that many people are gonna go and sew a shirt. And it probably won't change people's behavior much.

However, if I were to give you knowledge of how to do physics—and you engage in physics, looking at the world and understanding how things work, leading you to make better, more informed decisions—then that knowledge is valuable.

I think that's why people emphasize actionable advice. If it changes your actions and behavior, that's proof that the knowledge is valuable.

So, the actionable advice in this blog post is: if you want to know if what you're saying is actually valuable, ask yourself how much it will change the behavior of those who hear it.

Often, it's just about choosing the right thing. Maybe you know a lot about a topic, but it won't be that valuable to people. So, is it really worth your time to discuss that, or should you dive deeper into something else?

Also, it's not just about what you say—it's also about how you say it. The medium through which you're presenting your content matters.
