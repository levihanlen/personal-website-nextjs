I write everything by hand in this shorthand. It's increased my speed a lot.

Normal writing is slow, so I learned Gregg Shorthand (the most popular one). Gregg Shorthand is easy to write in, but very difficult to read back.

I didn't like that, so I made my own shorthand. This is both very fast to write, and very easy to read back.

Feel free to use it or improve it.

Here's quick infographic explaining the rules:
